# **C++ Projects - Programming and Data Structures**  
This repository contains a collection of C++ projects implemented as part of my coursework in **Programming and Data Structures** at the **University of Michigan**. These projects cover **algorithm design, object-oriented programming, data structures, and computational efficiency**.

## **📂 Projects Overview**  

### **1️⃣ Euchre AI Simulation**  
📌 **Description:** Implemented an AI-powered **Euchre card game** using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles.  
🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Designed **game logic and rules** using **Abstract Data Types (ADTs), inheritance, and polymorphism**.  
- Implemented AI decision-making using **strategic evaluation of hands** based on probability.  
- Developed a **fully functional game engine** that allows human vs. AI or AI vs. AI gameplay.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:** C++, STL, OOP, Unit Testing

### **3️⃣ Statistical Analysis Tool**  
📌 **Description:** Created a **C++ statistical analysis tool** to compute **descriptive statistics** and conduct **two-sample hypothesis testing** with **bootstrap confidence intervals**.  
🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Developed statistical functions including **mean, standard deviation, median, min/max values**.  
- Implemented **bootstrapping techniques** to calculate **95% confidence intervals** for hypothesis testing.  
- Processed and analyzed large datasets using **vectors and optimized control-flow structures**.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:** C++, STL, Vectors, Bootstrap Sampling

### **4️⃣ Binary Search Tree (BST) & Map Implementation**  
📌 **Description:** Designed a **self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST)** and implemented a **map container** similar to `std::map` using **templated programming**.  
🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Implemented BST **insertion, deletion, and search** operations with logarithmic efficiency.  
- Created a **map ADT** that supports **key-value pair storage** and efficient lookup.  
- Utilized **recursion and functors** to maintain sorting invariants.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:** C++, Templates, Recursion, Associative Containers

### **5️⃣ List Editor - Text Buffer with Linked List**  
📌 **Description:** Developed a **terminal-based text editor** similar to `nano` using a **doubly linked list** for **dynamic text manipulation**.  
🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Designed a **List ADT** with efficient **insert, delete, and cursor movement operations**.  
- Implemented **dynamic memory allocation** with proper handling of **new/delete** to prevent memory leaks.  
- Developed **text navigation features**, including **row/column tracking** and **line-breaking logic**.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:** C++, Linked Lists, Dynamic Memory, Iterators
